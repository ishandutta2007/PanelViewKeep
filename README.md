#Panel View for Keep

Panelized extension for Google's note-taking service Keep.

After you download the zip, extract it to the folder location of your choice on your hard drive.
In Chrome, click the menu button > Tools > Extensions. In the top right corner, make sure "Developer mode" is checked. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button. Navigate to the extension's folder, click it to select it, and click OK.
That should do it; the Keep icon should appear next to the URL bar. Right click the icon for settings, etc. etc.
Enjoy!

##FAQ

1. **I don't get it. This just opens Google Keep in a new tab.**

   Not so! This extension serves as a shortcut to [keep.google.com](http://keep.google.com), but also much more. You'll find at the bottom of Keep's sidebar (click the hamburger icon (â˜°) to open it), a new link entitled "Send to Panel." Click that and you're on your way.

2. **When I click "Send to Panel," it opens a popup window, not a panel.**

   Unfortunately, Chrome disables the panel API by default. To override this, you'll need to enable it in [chrome:flags](chrome://flags/#enable-panels) and restart Chrome. Now you're ready to use panels.

3. **Why can't I upload an image when Keep is in panel view?**

   This is a known bug with panels. Read more about this issue on [crbug.com](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463367&q=panel%20upload&colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified).

  - Fixed Share Note screen in the panel.

- Fixed console errors due to invalid window and tab IDs.

2.8.2
- Fixed bug where reminders were not visible in single note view.

2.8.1
- Fixed bug where checklist notes without a title were being hidden in the collapsed list view.

2.8
- Reverted to default list view.
- Added an option (below "Send to Tab") to enable collapsed list view.
- Added the "storage" permission so the extension remembers the option.
- Cleaned up source styles.

2.7.1
- Changed list view to show collapsed notes.

2.6

- Fixed typos in readme and building docs.

2.5

2.2

2.1
- Added keep.google.com to the list of permissions. (keep.google.com previously redirected to drive.google.com/keep, but it doesn't.)

2.0
- Changes to reflect Google's updated look for the Keep website.

1.8
- Fixed some wonky styling. Yes, "wonky" is a word, because I said so.

1.7
- Added a "Send to" icon on the rightmost side of the black bar, which enables easy switching between tab and panel.
- User account switching!
- Options page moved to an in-window dialog. The only option for now is the context menu toggle. The extension itself will remember in which view you last opened Keep.
