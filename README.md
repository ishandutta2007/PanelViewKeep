#Panel View for Keep

Panelized extension for Google's note-taking service Keep.

After you download the zip, extract it to the folder location of your choice on your hard drive.
In Chrome, click the menu button > Tools > Extensions. In the top right corner, make sure "Developer mode" is checked. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button. Navigate to the extension's folder, click it to select it, and click OK.
That should do it; the Keep icon should appear next to the URL bar. Right click the icon for settings, etc. etc.
Enjoy!

##Changelog

2.5
- Fixed CSS bug when the Share button on a note is clicked without first opening the note.
- Fixed toolbar icon. The 2.4 update had the wrong icon by accident.
- Added keep-sharing.google.com to permissions.

2.4
- Cleaned up remaining unused options dialog code.

2.3
- No longer opens existing tab ID if the tab is not on Keep anymore.

2.2
- Removed permissions for storage and context menus, and associated scripts.
- Removed options, because the only option was to enable context menus, which are now removed.
- Removed storage for whether to open in tab or panel. By default, Panel View will now always open in a tab, in a new browser session.

2.1
- Added keep.google.com to the list of permissions. (keep.google.com previously redirected to drive.google.com/keep, but it doesn't.)

2.0
- Changes to reflect Google's updated look for the Keep website.

1.8
- Fixed some wonky styling. Yes, "wonky" is a word, because I said so.

1.7
- Added a "Send to" icon on the rightmost side of the black bar, which enables easy switching between tab and panel.
- User account switching!
- Options page moved to an in-window dialog. The only option for now is the context menu toggle. The extension itself will remember in which view you last opened Keep.
